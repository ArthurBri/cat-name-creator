# Cat Name Creator

<img src="src/assets/images/kitty.svg" width="100" height="100">

Just a little tool to create names based on random letters.  
I used it for naming my cat, use TDD approach and work on Typescript w/ vue.

## Main features

- Generate a random name from 1 to 15 letters
- Lock letters you want, for example if you want a name starting by "S", or ending by "O".
- Chose the number of vowels of the name (to avoid too much consonants)
